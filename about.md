## About Me

{{site.description}}

I make Minecraft plugins, mods, datapacks and maps (the technical part, I totally suck at building) and arduino projects including some really fun ones that I'm going to post here in the future. I'm not too bad at math, but I'm still figuring it out (it's pretty important for the stuff I'm doing).

Oh yeah, and I like cats and coding. Who would have thought.
